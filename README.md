# CompGraphics

We had two assignments and one term project to work on throughout the semester in my graduate-level ***Computer Graphics I*** course.

## `opengl_raytracing`
The two assignments built off each other and can be found under the `opengl_raytracing` subdirectory. 

  - This assignment challenged me to build my own 3D virtual world using a skybox, shading, local and global illumination, ray tracing, user interactivity via keyboard & mouse I/O (ex. change camera position/zoom, turning lights on/off, etc.), importing `OBJ` files (i.e., models) and decoding `PNG` or `JPG` files for applying textures on to the models, building a custom camera system, working with linear algebra concepts, etc.
  - `C++`, `OpenGL`, `assimp`, `stb_image.h`, `Visual Studio 2022`, `Git` & `GitHub`, and `Blender` were used significantly for this assignment.

## `termproject_render_3d_objs`
Our term project was given so we could understand computer graphics concepts from a completely different perspective and can be found under the subdirectory titled `termproject_render_3d_objs`.

  - In other words, instead of programming our objects directly (see previous paragraph), we were challenged to reconstruct 3D object(s) from the real world using various computational techniques.
  - For this project, I used `Python`, `OpenCV-Python`, `COLMAP`, and `MeshLab`.
